Abstract Factory Pattern Overview
- Intent: The Abstract Factory pattern is designed to allow the creation of families of related objects without needing to specify their concrete classes. It enables a client to create a set of related objects without knowing their exact types.

* When to Use the Abstract Factory Pattern
	- When a system needs to be independent of how its products are created.
	- When a system needs to work with multiple families of related products.
	- When you want to enforce constraints regarding which objects can be used together.

*Structure of the Abstract Factory Pattern

- Abstract Factory: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract products.
- Concrete Factory: Implements the operations to create concrete products.
- Abstract Product: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
- Concrete Product: Implements the abstract product interface.
- Client: Uses only interfaces declared by the Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes.
